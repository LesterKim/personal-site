# Intro

I am a software engineer at an undisclosed [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) startup where I build a web application for institutional investors. I also hire engineers and advise people looking for tech jobs. I am particularly interested in projects that touch cryptocurrency and quantum computing. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

I primarily work as a back-end engineer but have experience across the entire stack.
